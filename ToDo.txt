/**
 * HIGH
 * bugs in the rendering of total with mBtc and bits
 * collapse flows, create new money packet rolls into transactions
 * 
 * MEDIUM:
 * zero fee transaction
 * gpg
 * mobile
 * hd
 * password recovery service
 * allow funds to be viewable
 * fireworks for tips
 * password requirements, especially with bip38
 * modifying textarea causes page to advance, only initial paste
 * play with URLs, e.g. add URL to file then one click claim
 * FAQ and/or video
 * link to where you can spend bitcoins on success screens
 * breadcrumb trail?
 * auto-delete invalid paste
 * 
 * LOW:
 * super streamlined claim option?
 * make a giant green claim button to reinforce the idea that sender has access?
 * offline mode isn't reliably detected
 * keyboard navigation through most of it?
 * rather than positive amt, positive amt above and beyond dust
 * use bitcoin qr code generator instead
 * reconcile imported vs unlocked terminology
 * when adding funds to unlocked, display add amount plus new balance
 * prevent text overlay when flipping quickly?
 * import, unlock, then go back and wrong password, should probably clear. or don't allow password again
 * clearly state browser requirements
 * allow qr codes to be opened with wallet
 * if invalid mp upload, clear upload form
 * refactor to be truly object-oriented?
 * inconsistent naming convention from _error to _msg
 * realtime amount validations do not report negative amounts
 * automatically import mp after new mp created and funded
 * set expiration date to claim funds before they're returned
 * compute minimum send amount and pre-validate in forms instead of try catch
 * Give credit to BitPay for BitCore and recommend CoPay as the best wallet I have used to date
 * Step by step both the features and the process.
 * Sender may continue to add funds to a money packet at any time. (HD coming eventually, if possible)
 * mouse movements to generate private key
